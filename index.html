            <p>Te Puia, located in Rotorua, New Zealand, is a cultural and geothermal destination that showcases both Maori traditions and the natural wonders of the Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley. It's home to the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute, where visitors can witness traditional carving and weaving, and it also features the famous Pōhutu Geyser, bubbling mud pools, and native kiwi birds.</p>
            <p>Te Puia, specifically the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute within it, has been around since 1963, when it was established by the NZ Māori Arts & Crafts Institute Act. This makes it 61 years old in 2024. It was created to preserve and promote Māori arts and culture.</p>
